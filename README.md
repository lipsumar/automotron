## What is the AUTOMOTRON ?

The AUTOMOTRON is a visual language to generate texts. 


## How does it work ?

### Basics

The most basic blocks are the "containers". The containers are used to produce the output text. The container with a green border is always used as the starting point of the text.

This is the most basic example:

![a basic example showing 3 connected containers](resources/basic.png)

The above example will always produce the same text:

> Hello, my name is John

A container can be connected to more than one other container. This will create an alternate route:

![an example showing alternate route](resources/alternate-route.png)

The above example could produce:

> Hello, my name is John

or

> Hello, my name is Sarah

### Generators

Most often than not, generating texts will rely on long lists (for example a list of 50+ names). Representing long lists using separate containers and alternate routes is not practical. In such cases, containers can be connected to generators:

The above example could produce:

> Hello, my name is Mary

or

> Hello, my name is Jennifer

or

> Hello, my name is James

etc...


### Operators

Operators help to control the flow of the text, allowing loops or conditional structures.

The "split" operator allows to either go to route A or B. The chance A or B will be chosen can be defined, so there could be more chance to take a route than another

![an example showing the split operator](resources/split-operator.png)

The above example could produce:

> Hello, my name is Patricia

or

> Hello, my name is none of your business

The split operator can be used to make loops, like so:

![an example demonstrating the use of the split operator to create loops](resources/split-operator-loop.png)

The above example could produce:

> Hello, my name is Michael or maybe Mary i'm not really sure...

or

> Hello, my name is Elizabeth or maybe Elizabeth or maybe Linda or maybe James or maybe Robert or maybe William i'm not really sure...


## Controls

* The map can be zoomed in or out with by scrolling up or down
* The map can also be moved by dragging on an empty area
* A double click in an empty area will create a container
* A double click on a container or list generator will edit it; afterwards, [cmd+enter] will save the changes
* A right clic on an empty area will open a menu to create a List or a Split
* A double click on a link will delete it
* The output tray can be closed by clicking on the gray bar
* To generate text, click "play" on top-left of the screen
